# SecureBeam

SecureBeam is being rebuilt with native applications for faster, more reliable file transfers.

## Status

The browser-based WebRTC implementation has been discontinued due to platform limitations. We're developing native desktop applications starting with Windows.

## Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages on push to master.
